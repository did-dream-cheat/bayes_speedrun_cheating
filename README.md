# Quick Intro

From the report's current Executive Summary:

> Two analyses I've read of Dream's recent speedrunning performance have been flawed. I believe I can do better, and so I've done my own analysis. I point out a number of flaws with the two existing analysis, the most notable of which are the Minecraft Speedrunning Team's reliance on p-values and Photoexcitation's failure to mention that Bayesian methods are inherently less likely to conclude Dream cheated. I walk through the logic and mathematics behind my approach, which relies heavily on Bayesian statistics and conjugate priors. I implement said math in two Python routines, which allows anyone to easily run their own analysis, and put them to use with a more rigorous analysis of Dream's performance than is in either report. This analysis is easily reproducible and can be applied outside of Minecraft speedrunning.

> Overall, I find the probability of Dream cheating to be much lower than the Minecraft Speedruning Team's report, at least five orders of magnitude lower in fact. Nonetheless, I also find his performance to be more consistent with simulated players who modified their version of Minecraft than with simulated players who did not or with comparable real-world Minecraft speedrunners. I do not make a definitive conclusion, in deference to the Minecraft speedrunning community.

> I also point out an apparent oversight in the speedrunning community which could allow for different styles of cheating that are tougher to detect than usual. I also outline how to detect them, of course.

Currently, I consider this report to be mostly but not entirely finished. I have made no attempt at spell-checking it, and it probably needs a grammar pass. The math appears correct, but could use a double-check. Overall, though, I think it is in good enough shape to ask for feedback on it. A PDF version of it will be coming shortly, but in the meantime you can run the notebook yourself on Google Colab:
