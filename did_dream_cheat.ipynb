    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I first became aware of the situation via [a blog I follow](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/12/24/dream-investigation-results-official-report-by-the-minecraft-speedrunning-team/). As someone who has watched some of Dream's video content and is casually addicted to Minecraft, I was drawn to read the Minecraft Speedrunning Team's [report](https://mcspeedrun.com/dream.pdf). It is very well written, in my opinion, and the team behind it has put a lot of time and effort into creating a thorough investigation. Nonetheless, it made several assumptions I do not think are warranted, assumptions that create fundamental problems with the analysis it presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "That same blog post pointed me towards a [rebuttal report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yfLURFdDhMfrvI2cFMdYM8f_M_IRoAlM/view), which had been declared \"[hilariously bad](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/12/24/dream-investigation-results-official-report-by-the-minecraft-speedrunning-team/#comment-1622865)\" and riddled with \"[absurd errors](https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/kiqosv/d_accused_minecraft_speedrunner_who_was_caught/ggse2er/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medtook%20time%20to%20review%20theium=web2x&context=3).\" My primary critiques of the MST's report were not present, surprisingly, which drew me to read the rebuttal. It also made some faulty assumptions, and again some of what I considered to be the most important ones were missed by the critiques. While not perfect by any means, it was better than I was led to believe.\n",
    "\n",
    "I asked myself if I could create a better report. After some thought, I realized the analysis was quite similar to others I've done in the past, and so I started work on what you are currently reading.\n",

    "## Declaration of Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a graduate student in computer science, specializing in computer graphics. I have not taken a university-level statistics course, though I have taken two courses on cryptography and information theory, and those subjects rely heavily on probability. Neither taught me anything new about probability; my interest in algorithms and philosophy have led me to casually study the statistics underlying science. I've found that self-study to be of immense use, as all my research has relied on statistical analysis at some level. At best, I can be considered an amateur statistician.\n",
    "\n",
    "My plan to compensate for my lack of authority is to be more detailed and open. I am not anonymous, I can easily be found online via my pen name. I will walk through all the math I employ, and explain my analysis and logic as I go.

I have not been contacted by him or any third party, let alone asked to write this report.** I have enjoyed watching some of his videos, and I believe he is a very talented Minecraft player, but I am indifferent to whether or not his speed runs are considered valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By the same token, I have no relationship with the Minecraft speedrunning community. None of them have contacted or paid me to write this report, directly or via a third party.** I have no plans on becoming a Minecraft speed runner, I'm content to merely build things and do some casual streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "My motivations for writing this report can be boiled down to this:\n",

    "The [MST report](https://mcspeedrun.com/dream.pdf) is quite good. The authors go into extensive detail on the mechanics of how Blaze rod and Pigmen drops work, to the point of analyzing how random numbers are generated within Minecraft. They compare Dream's performance to other runners, which is vital to help rule out flaws in your analysis. If the analysis shows *all* of the top players are cheating, then either cheating is rampant or something is wrong with your analysis. The report goes into quite a bit of detail into the methods used, and shares code to help with reproducibility. I believe it is a good attempt to \"present \\[an\\] unbiased, rigorous statistical analysis of the data\" (pg. 4).\n",

    "\n",
    "On its surface, it's a very strange metric. Why are we basing our decision on data we have not and will never observe? What counts as \"extreme\"? The core logic relies on both [modus tollens](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ModusTollens.html)\\footnote{If A is true, B is true; B is false; ergo A is false.} and [the central limit theorem](https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/BS704_Probability/BS704_Probability12.html)\\footnote{The means of sufficiently large samples taken from a larger population will follow a Gaussian distribution centred at the population mean.}, which are usually correct but not always so.\\cite{cohen_earth_1994,vanderplas_frequentism_2014} \n",

    "P-values are not a probability of the null hypothesis being incorrect and cannot be treated as such, yet the MST report declares their final p-value to be an \"upper bound on the chance\" of Dream getting that lucky (pg. 22). The text which popularized the p-value encourages this mistake.\n",
    "\n",

    "### P-values Exaggerate the Evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple studies have looked into the predictive power of p-values by simulating experiments.\\cite{hubbard_why_2008,colquhoun2014investigation,halsey_fickle_2015} These should be taken with a grain of salt, as many of them argue p-values exaggerate the evidence relative to Bayesian methods. If you believe hypotheses can only be true or false, and cannot be assigned probability values, then you believe Bayesian methods are invalid and thus cannot be used as a reference. Not all of these simulation studies use that reference, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this article, I investigate p-values in relation to replication. My conclusion is that, if you repeat an experiment, you are likely to obtain a p-value quite different from the p in your original experiment. The p-value is actually a very unreliable measure, and it varies dramatically over replications, even with large sample sizes. Therefore, any p-value gives only very vague information about what is likely to happen on replication, and any single p-value could easily have been quite different, simply because of sampling variability.\\cite{doi:10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00079.x}\n",
    "\n",
    "The evidence has become strong enough that some researchers have proposed lowering the traditional p-value cut-off of 0.05 to a lower value.\\cite{Johnson19313} The theory is that rather than asking scientists to abandon the use of p-values, it is simpler to compensate by lowering the threshold for significance and thus increasing the amount of evidence required to reach that bar. Some fields of science have already made that transition, for instance particle physics and genomics research often require $p < 0.0000003$. If p-values exaggerate the evidence against the null hypothesis, and the null hypothesis is that Dream's drop rate was unmodified, then by using p-values the MST report is exaggerating the evidence against Dream. This alone makes another report worthwhile.\n",

The MST report does not consider this. As my later analysis will show, this does have a significant impact on the probabilities. I also agree that the last game Dream played in the analysis should be treated differenly than the last, due to the same logic that led me to conclude trades/drops do not follow the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PE report's decision to use Bayesian statistics was correct, as in my opinion it copes better with small sample sizes than frequentist methods such as the p-value.

Considering all Minecraft worlds ever played and the multitude of ways in which luck plays a role, even one in a trillion events happen daily.\n",

This is because I have no interest in reaching \"The End\" at the moment, nor have I had the inclination in the six months or so I've been playing this game. If that did change, I'm playing on a private server with other people who have long since tracked down a stronghold on our shared map and set up a minecart route to it. In practice, gathering the materials to make an Eye of Ender is something most Minecraft players rarely do, and when they attempt it is only rarely done more than once the entire time they play Minecraft. Only a very small fraction of the Minecraft community attempts to speedrun the game, and only those players routinely hunt for Ender pearls and Blaze rods. One in a trillion events can happen daily, but only if about a trillion attempts are made at those events per day.\n",

    "### Lack of a Comparison to Real World Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This premise leads the PE report to forgo comparisons to other speedrunners.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Comparison to other runners is not necessary to establish that Dream had very low probability runs. Instead this comparison is more relevant to the interpretation of these low probabilities. For example, it reduces the plausibility that the low probabilities were due to some universal glitch that affects all speedrunners. As the reader is assessing the evidence, the low probability of Dream’s runs and that Dream performed much better than other speedrunners should not be considered as independent pieces of evidence as they both are consequences of the same thing. Any lucky speedrunner chosen because they look lucky will look lucky when compared to other speedrunner\n",
    "streams that were chosen randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of statistics is the idea of [a reference class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_class_problem):. By invoking every Minecraft player, the PE report is stating that Dream's performance should be compared to them, or in other words that they are the appropriate class of entities to use as a reference. Here, though, the report argues that Dream's performance should not be compared to that of other top speed runners, because it is too dissimilar and therefore makes a poor reference class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting aside the argument that this is the reverse of reality, it is notable that the report makes no attempt to compare Dream's performance to any real-world reference class. If a perfect Blaze rod and Ender pearl bartering session is indeed a common occurance, it should be easy to demonstrate that by pointing to a few examples of ordinary Minecraft players acheiving those feats. Even if they are rarely recorded, discussion of such events must appear in comment sections or Discord channel messages, and we would expect it to be common knowledge among players of Minecraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, even if other speedrunners are an inappropriate reference class, running their performance through the report's simulation would be a valuable check that it is working properly. This is why scientific studies usually have control groups, as they are a validation of the methodology. The author of this report had the data to do this, thanks to the MST report, and passing it through their simulation was as easy as editing two lines of code, so there was no lack of means or opportunity."

    "\n",
    "Mathematically, \"credence\" is the output of a [likelihood function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function). Likelihoods obey all the same rules as probabilities, save one: while probabilities are bounded to stay between 0 and 1, likelihoods only have a lower bound of zero. The inputs to a likelihood function are the data we observe, as well as parameters used to describe a model of our belief in that data. These parameters form a multi-dimensional parameter space. All hypotheses we can make about the data live within that space. These may be point hypotheses (\"Dream's Blaze rod drop rate was precisely 0.509583957\"), or composite hypotheses that are a weighted subset of all possible point hypotheses (\"Dream's Blaze rod drop rate ranged between 0.45 and 0.55\"). If the parameter space is discrete (\"which side of a six-sided die will appear\"), that weighted subset is calculated by summation over all possible parameters; if it is continuous (\"Dream's Blaze rod drop rate\"), it is calculated by integration over all parameters.\n",

    "Unfortunately, calculating those integrals directly is impractical for all but the easiest problems. Frustrated statisticians and mathematicians began looking for shortcuts and alternatives, and a number of them were codified into what we now call frequentist statistics. The p-value is one such example: it also relies on likelihood functions, but it assumes the amount of data collected is practically infinite. This allows the problem to be transformed via the central limit theorem into another that's much easier to integrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has an important side-effect: the flip-side of p-values exaggerating the evidence is that Bayesian metrics are relatively conservative when given the same evidence. if the default hypothesis is some variation of \"did Dream play fair?\", then Bayesian statistics will be slower to give up on that than frequentist statistics. To put that in bold:\n",

    "**Bayesian statistics is intrinsically more likely to conclude Dream played fairly, relative to frequentist statistics, given the same evidence.** Whether this is a problem or not depends on how sound you think the premises are behind each system. If you think hypotheses can only be true or false, and cannot have probabilities assigned to them, then you reject Bayesian statistics outright. It's not unfair to invoke p-values if the \"fairer\" analysis begins with \"assume five angels can dance on a pinhead...\". By the same token, a Bayesian analysis of Dream's performance is not biased towards him relative to one that uses p-values, provided you think p-values should not be applied to this problem."

It is convenient to define your likelihood function as how your credence changes given one atom of data, because then you can chain together arbitrary numbers of likelihood functions to handle arbitrary amounts of evidence.

Likewise, the odds of a specific speedrunner cheating are low if speedrunners in general rarely cheat, again absent any evidence leading us to one conclusion or another.\n",

The odds of earning 40 Ender pearls, or any number between 20 and 423, must be somewhere between those two reference points.\n",
